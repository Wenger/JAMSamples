JAMScript Shell Program
=======================

The JAMScript Shell allows multiple programs to be hooked and executed. The binary is currently named `jamshell` and would be the name installed to the system path 

Starting the Shell (before npm install)
---------------------------------------

Via testing it can be started with:

`node index.js <hook name>`

For example: `node index.js flow`

The Hook names currently defined are: "flow", "jdata", "jdiscovery", "jview", "jamscript". However, these can be modified or removed or more could be added.

Starting the Shell (after npm install)
-----------------------------------------

After installing, running the application from the terminal should be as easy as:

`jamshell <hook name>`

For example: `jamshell flow`

Adding/Modifying Hooks
----------------------

The `index.js` file in the root directory has a `types` variable which states the Hooks which are currently supported.
All Hooks extend the `Hook` class defined in `hook.js`. The hook class defines a `prompt` property which will be used as the shell prompt.
The default is `App>`. This can be modified in the extending class. Each hook can also define the character that triggers the command to be executed. By default the newline character (`\n`) is used. This can be modified by setting the `trigger` property in the constructor. For example:

```javascript
var Hook = require('./hook.js');

class MyHook extends Hook{
    constructor(opts){
        super(opts);
        this.trigger = ";"  //trigger command when the user presses semi-colon
    }
}
```

Adding Commands to Hooks
------------------------

When ever a command is ***triggered***, the `execute` method of the active Hook receives the command and is expected to run synchronously. The Hook class defines utility methods for parsing commands. These could be used by subclasses. The same build object can used to show Usage help and also parsed to obtain required data from the terminal.
As example of the build object is shown below:

```javascript
class MyHook extends Hook{
    ...
    execute(code){
        // command: ds <name>
        // description: List the data streams in the data source specified in <name>
        // options:
        // -f, --from <index> The offset/index to start from
        // -t, --to <index> The index to end
        // -h, --help See usage help
        
        //If we have the above elements for our command, we can build it as follows:
        var build = {
            cmd: "ds <name>",
            desc: "List the data streams in the data source specified in <name>",
            opts: [
                {cmd: "-f, --from <index>", desc: "The offset/index to start from"},
                {cmd: "-t, --to <index>", desc: "The index to end"},
                {cmd: "-h, --help", desc: "See usage help"}
            ],
            code: code,
            number: ['from', 'to']
        };
    }             
    ...
}
```

In order to parse the build object, we call the method defined in the Hook class as:

```javascript
var parsed = this.parse(build);
```

To generate the Help from that object we can do the following:

```javascript
this.printHelp(build);
```

Ideally, we would want to first check if the user has specified the help flag by doing:

```javascript
var parsed = this.parse(build);
if( parsed.help ){
    this.printHelp(build);
    return;
}
```

The required options for the build are:

1. cmd: The command pattern as is `<command>` or `<command> <arg1> <arg2> ... <argN>`.
Now bear in mind that the names the command arguments are significant to retrieving the data stored in them. 
As an example:
   
    ```javascript
        var build = {
            cmd: "listfiles <dir> <ext>",
            ...
        }
        
        //the above creates a command that requires a directory (<dir>) 
        //and file extension (<ext>). The following are obtainable:
        
        var parsed = this.parse(build);
        if( parsed.dir != null && parsed.ext != null )
            doSomething(parsed.dir, parsed.ext);
        else if( parsed.dir != null )
            doSomethingElse(parsed.dir);
        else{
            this.printHelp(build);
            return;
        }
    ```
    
    The command arguments are deemed as required (meaning that they will always be set) and the order is preserved. They will be set to `null` if they are not provided by the user.
    
    It is to be noted that the options can come either between the command and the command arguments or after the command arguments. As an example with the sample `MyHook` class, the following will yield the same output:
    
    ```
    jdata> ds logger --from 0 -t 5
    jdata> ds --from 0 -t 5 logger
    jdata> ds -f 0 -t 5 logger
    jdata> ds logger --to=5 --from=0
    ```

2. code: This is the full command string passed into the execute function  
   
   
   
The following options are supported but are optional:

1. desc: The description of the Command. Used to generate the Usage Help.
2. opts: The array of possible options which can be specified by the user. Each option is an object that must have at least a `cmd` property. The desc is optional and is mainly used for generating the Usage Help. The `cmd` property can list several aliases as in:

    ```javascript
    var build = {
        ...
        opts: [
            {cmd: "-s, --size <number>", desc: "The maximum file size to show"},
            {cmd: "-t, --timestamp, --time <unix-time>"},
            {cmd: "--display-as-grid", desc: "Show files in Grid form"},
            {cmd: "-n, --no-empty", desc: "Ignore empty files"}
        ]
        ...
    }
    ```
    
    Unlike the `build.cmd` property, the identifier in angle brackets (< ... >) in the `build.opts.cmd` are not significant. They are just used as hints especially when generating the Usage Help.
    
    **NOTE**: 
    
    i. A property like `--display-as-grid` will be converted to camelCase and be accessed from the parsed object as `parsed.displayAsGrid`
    
    ii. A property starting with `--no` as with `--no-empty` with evaluate to boolean as `{empty: false}` if specified.


3. number: An array of options and/or command arguments that should be treated as numbers.
4. boolean: An array of options and/or command arguments that should be treated as boolean.
5. string: An array of options and/or command arguments that should be treated as strings even if they appears as numbers.
